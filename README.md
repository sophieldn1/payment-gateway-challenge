# Instructions for candidates

This is the .NET version of the Payment Gateway challenge. If you haven't already read this [README.md](https://github.com/cko-recruitment/) on the details of this exercise, please do so now. 

## Template structure
```
src/
    PaymentGateway.Api - a skeleton ASP.NET Core Web API
test/
    PaymentGateway.Api.Tests - an empty xUnit test project
imposters/ - contains the bank simulator configuration. Don't change this

.editorconfig - don't change this. It ensures a consistent set of rules for submissions when reformatting code
docker-compose.yml - configures the bank simulator
PaymentGateway.sln
```

Feel free to change the structure of the solution, use a different test library etc.

## Design considerations

For a clean and maintainable approach, I used services to contain business logic keeping the controller thin and focused on HTTP concerns, a repository layer for data access - change in data store then won't affect business logic, interfaces for services + repositories which allows for DI overall helping keep code loosely coupled. 
Validation was isolated also.
